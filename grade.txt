Simple application that mixes programming styles. There is a lack of separation of concerns, mainly the database 
functionality is inlined in most methods rather than put in a controller in itself. Same goes for JavaFX, where 
fxml sometimes is used and sometimes not (opting for programming the GUI). This mix makes it a bit difficult to 
maintain in the long run. Also, there are a few cases where Swing has been used rather than JavaFX (JOptionPane) 
which makes it look rather strange.

Presentation
------------
Okay, you know your application fairly well and some of the weaknesses (like how to add a recipie) are shown. 
Good speed and content.
